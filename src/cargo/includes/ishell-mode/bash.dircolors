DIR 38;5;32 # Regular directory.
STICKY 03;38;5;32 # Owner-exclusive directory control.
# When set on a directory, files can only be removed by the owner.
# For example, the `/tmp` directory can be written to by any user,
# but other users cannot delete the files of others.

STICKY_OTHER_WRITABLE 03;38;5;132 # Publicly modifiable but sticky-bit safe.

SETGID 03;38;5;132 # Group-inherited contents.
# - When `setgid` is used on files, itâ€™s similar to the `setuid` permission.
#   A file, when executed, will run as the group that owns the file.
# - When a directory has `setgid` it will cause all files that are created in that directory
#   to be owned by the group of the directory as opposed to the group of the owner.
